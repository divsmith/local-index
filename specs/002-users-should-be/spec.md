# Feature Specification: Optional Directory Selection for Indexing and Searching

**Feature Branch**: `002-users-should-be`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Users should be able to optionally select the directory to index. This should also be the directory where the index files are placed. Users should also be able to optionally select the directory with the index files to use when searching."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: User description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users
   ‚Üí Actions: select directory to index, select directory with index files for searching
   ‚Üí Data: directories, index files
   ‚Üí Constraints: optional selection, index files placed in same directory as indexed content
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear user flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users want the flexibility to choose which directories to index and where to store index files, as well as the ability to search using existing index files from specific locations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has a directory they want to index, **When** they provide the directory path during indexing, **Then** the system should create index files in that same directory
2. **Given** the user has previously created index files in a directory, **When** they provide that directory path during searching, **Then** the system should use the existing index files for search operations
3. **Given** the user does not specify a directory, **When** they run indexing or searching, **Then** the system should use a default directory behavior

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the specified directory does not exist?
- How does system handle directories without read/write permissions?
- What happens when index files are corrupted or missing in the specified directory?
- How does system handle extremely large directories?
- What happens when the same directory is indexed multiple times?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to optionally specify a target directory for indexing operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST create and store index files in the same directory as the content being indexed
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to optionally specify a directory containing existing index files for searching operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear feedback when specified directories are not accessible or do not exist
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility and use the current directory when no directory is specified. 
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that index files exist and are valid before using them for searching
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle permission errors gracefully when attempting to access specified directories
- **FR-008**: System MUST support relative and absolute directory paths. Both need to be supported.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What type of user interface should be used for directory selection? ‚Üí A: Command-line interface (CLI) flags/arguments for directory paths
- Q: How should the system handle index file naming conflicts when multiple index operations target the same directory? ‚Üí A: Overwrite existing index files automatically
- Q: What should be the maximum directory size or file count limit for indexing operations? ‚Üí A: Configurable limits with reasonable defaults (e.g., 1GB/10K files)
- Q: How should the system handle symbolic links during directory traversal? ‚Üí A: Follow links only within the same directory tree
- Q: What file types or patterns should be excluded from indexing by default? ‚Üí A: Provide configurable ignore patterns with sensible defaults

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Index Directory**: The location where source content and index files are stored together
- **Index Files**: Search index data structures created during indexing operations
- **Source Content**: The files and directories that are being indexed for search
- **Search Operation**: The process of using existing index files to find content
