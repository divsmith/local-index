# Feature Specification: High Performance Local CLI Vectorized Codebase Search

**Feature Branch**: `001-high-performance-local`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "high performance local CLI vectorized codebase search"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer needs to quickly search through their local codebase to find specific code patterns, function definitions, or usages. The user runs a CLI command from their project directory and receives instant, accurate search results that help them navigate and understand their codebase more efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a local codebase with multiple files, **When** user executes the search command with a query term, **Then** the system returns all relevant code matches within a reasonable time (under 2 seconds for typical searches)
2. **Given** multiple files containing the search term, **When** user executes the search command, **Then** the system displays the filename, line number, and context for each match
3. **Given** a search query that matches code, **When** user executes the search command, **Then** the system returns results ordered by relevance using vectorized similarity matching
4. **Given** the user is in a project directory with subdirectories, **When** user executes the search command, **Then** the system searches recursively through all relevant files in subdirectories

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the codebase is extremely large, e.g. 1M+ lines? The system should provide progress feedback and eventually return results, though with longer processing time
- How does system handle binary files or files with unsupported encodings? The system should skip these files and continue searching through valid text files
- What occurs when the search query is malformed or contains special characters? The system should handle special characters appropriately and return relevant matches

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for searching local codebases
- **FR-002**: System MUST index and search through code files recursively in the current directory and subdirectories
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to execute searches with text queries that find relevant code patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST return search results with filename, line number, and code context for each match
- **FR-005**: System MUST prioritize search results using vectorized similarity matching to ensure most relevant results appear first
- **FR-006**: System MUST support common programming language file types (e.g., .js, .ts, .py, .java, .cpp, .c, .go, .rs, .swift, .rb, .php, .html, .css, .md, .yaml, .json)
- **FR-007**: System MUST execute searches with high performance (response under 2 seconds for repositories up to 100,000 lines, under 10 seconds for repositories up to 1,000,000 lines)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide filters to exclude common irrelevant files (e.g., node_modules/, .git/, __pycache__/, *.log, build/, dist/, target/, .DS_Store)
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to execute searches from any subdirectory within a project and have it search the entire project scope
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user

### Key Entities
- **Search Query**: The text or pattern the user wants to search for in the codebase
- **Code Index**: The internal representation of the codebase that enables fast vectorized search
- **Search Result**: A match containing file path, line number, matched text, and context
- **Codebase**: The collection of source code files being searched
