# Research: High Performance Local CLI Vectorized Codebase Search

## Decision: Vector Database Selection
**Rationale**: After researching available Go vector database solutions, I've decided to implement the vector search functionality using a combination of Go's native vector libraries and serialization for the embedded database. This approach provides good performance while keeping dependencies minimal.

## Alternatives Considered:
1. **GorillaDB/Vector**: A pure Go library for vector operations - lightweight but limited in advanced features
2. **Using CGO with FAISS**: Facebook's FAISS library provides excellent vector search capabilities but adds complexity with CGO
3. **Custom implementation with cosine similarity**: Building our own vector similarity algorithm in pure Go - most control but requires significant development time
4. **Qdrant Go client**: Qdrant is a high-performance vector search engine, but requires running an external service

## Decision: Code Parsing Strategy
**Rationale**: The system will use a language-agnostic approach that treats code as text for vectorization while also implementing basic tokenization to understand code structure better. This provides good performance while maintaining language flexibility.

## Alternatives Considered:
1. **AST-based parsing per language**: More accurate but complex implementation for multiple languages
2. **Language-specific parsers**: Better semantic understanding but requires multiple parser implementations
3. **Simple text-based approach**: Less sophisticated but simpler implementation that focuses on keyword and context matching

## Decision: Indexing Approach
**Rationale**: The system will implement incremental indexing that can update the vector database as files change. This provides good user experience with fast updates while maintaining search performance.

## Alternatives Considered:
1. **Full re-index on every search**: Simple but inefficient for larger codebases
2. **Time-based cache invalidation**: Could miss changes that happen between intervals
3. **File system watching**: Real-time updates but more complex implementation with system resource usage

## Performance Considerations
- Memory usage should be optimized to stay below 500MB during operation
- Indexing should be fast enough to handle moderate-sized repositories (up to 1M lines)
- Search response times should meet the requirements specified in the feature spec (under 2s for 100k lines, under 10s for 1M lines)
